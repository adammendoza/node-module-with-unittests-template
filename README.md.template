Write an awesome description for your new module here. You can edit this file and its contents for
your final README.md file. This template will go through the "replace:dist" step of the Gruntfile
which replaces 3 variables in this file (you can add more if you like).

1. @@unminimized_file : your unminimized library as produced by the "browserify:standalone" step in Gruntfile.js
2. @@minimized_file : your minimized library as produced by the "uglify:all" step in Gruntfile.js
3. @@pkg_version : the package version which is read from package.json.

Below, there is a sample "Downloads" section to show you how to use these 3 variables.

The output of "replace:dist" is your README.md file. The "markdown:all" step will also produce the html
equivalent of your README.md so that you can put this on your own website.
